# ResNetforEML
This code is for the final project of EML course. To design a classifer for 70 Dog Breeds-Image Data Set, I used the pretrained ResNet-18 and finetune it to make it suitable for our task. The dataset can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set
